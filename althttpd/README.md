========

NOTE: there is a more up-to-date mirror of the official altttpd fossil repo at https://github.com/jesrui/althttpd-mirror

This is a clone of [alhttpd](https://www.sqlite.org/docsrc/artifact/348b063918d0d38a90b956ac0c152ce32365bd7e),
the small, simple HTTP server distributed with the sqlite documentation.
It is currently (was?) serving [sqlite.org](http://www.mail-archive.com/fossil-users@lists.fossil-scm.org/msg02065.html)
and [core.tcl.tk](http://wiki.tcl.tk/37909).
